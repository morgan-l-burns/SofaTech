<h2 class="red">Automotive:  Leather Car Seat Repairs</h2>

<img src="/assets/images/beforeAndAfter/Audi-Garage-Photo-01.jpg" alt="Automotive, Leather Car Seat Repairs" id="garagePhoto"/>
<div class="justify">
<p>A used car that has an immaculate leather interior will sell better than one that is dirty or has scuffs &amp; tears.  In times when there is a higher stock availability of cars than customers, then the buyer will always choose quality and value. </p>

<p>Car interiors take a lot of wear and tear with extremes of temperatures, getting soiled, damp and wet.  We specialise in producing a repair which looks natural and blends in so that the finished product is an interior in immaculate condition, but also one that has been given a finish to match the age of the vehicle. So the natural characteristics of the leather are still there. Many repairs done by “smart repairers” give a freshly painted look, which stands out just like a worn seat does! </p>
</div>
<p>We offer a mobile repair service and can do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scuffs</li>
<li>Rips</li>
<li>Tears</li>
<li>Stitching</li>
<li>Cigarette burns</li>
<li>Split seams</li>
<li>Complete leather cleaning, care and protection</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="red">Leather Cleaning and Care: </h2>
<div class="justify">
<p>With the correct care leather will last and serve you well.  It is a natural product, it breathes and stretches.  Leather maintains itself at room temperature; it is durable, comfortable and elegant.  It is one of the few products which can actually improve with age.</p>

<p>Leather should be cleaned and protected at least three times a year (depending on use) using approved leather products.  We can offer the following:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Complete suite clean with professional leather cleaning products</li>
<li>Neutral leather cream after cleaning to ‘feed and nourish’ the leather</li>
<li>Leather re-odourising</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="red">On-site Re-upholstering Service</h2>

<img src="/assets/images/Diningchair2.jpg" id="dinningChair" alt="Dinning Chair" />
<div class="justify">
<p>We also offer an on-site re-upholstery service for all your tired, worn out dining room chairs!  You can choose a cover in either leather or fabric and then we can re-upholster your chairs in your home.  The chairs are usable upon completion.</p>
