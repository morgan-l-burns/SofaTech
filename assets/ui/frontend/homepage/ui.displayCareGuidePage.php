				<h2>Online Appointment Booking System</h2>
				<p class="justify">We have developed an Online Appointment Booking System to improve the service that we provide to you and your customers:</p>

<ul id="numberList">
<li>You login to the user area and add all of your customer details onto the system</li>
<li>This generates an appointment system for us to contact your customer</li>
<li>We book a mutually agreeable appointment with the customer</li>
<li>This visit information is recorded on the system by us</li>
<li>You receive notification of this - visit details are now available to view on the online calendar</li>
<li>We complete our service report and the system notifies you of this update – you can then go into the system and view/print the service</li>
</ul>

<p class="justify">This system is intended to save service departments time in chasing for appointment dates and improve work completion times. Working in this way ensures both you and your customers are more satisfied with our service.</p>
